            <h2>Who are they?</h2>
            <p>The Sherpa people (Sherpa meaning "westerner") are an ethnic group from Napal. They live in the Solu-Khumbu district, located in the high altitudes of the Himalayas. The Sherpas usually help to serve as guides for explorers, providing an invaluable service to those who want to climb some peaks.</p>

            <h2>A little history of the Sherpas</h2>
            <p>The Sherpas originate from Khans, located in eastern Tibet. They started to migrate in the 15th century because there was more forest in Kham at the time. They made a new living in their new land by hearding cattle and by trading salt, wool, and rice.</p>

            <p>The Sherpas practice a form of Tibetan Buddhism.</p>

            </div>
            <h2>Sherpa Clothing</h2>
            <p>Sherpa male and female fashion consists of a bakhu (thick wraparound robe) under a long inner skirt, with a sash belted around the waist. Male and females wear high boots that are colored maroon, red, and green. Women also dress in multicolored striped aprons to cover the front and back of their bodies below the waist. Married and unmarried women wear the rear apron, while only married women wear the front apron.</p>

            <h2>What They Do</h2>
            <p>Sherpas are usually mountain guides. They are paid to help prepare trails, fix ropes, and carry equipment up the mountain.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="img">
            <h2>Why are they important?</h2>
            <p>That's a pretty easy question to answer. Basically, they help people get up the mountain. Whether it be from carrying heavy loads to repairing equipment, the Sherpas provide a valuable service to those who want to climb Mt. Everest.</p>
